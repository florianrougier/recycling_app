## TODO

> fill all empty sections and delete what is below

Find a relevant dataset to start (https://github.com/garythung/trashnet).
Select some classes we want to detect (glass, paper, plastic, metal...).
Build an algorithm so differentiate between these classes.
Using the product information, we can tell which container the product have to be put in.

### Improve the model

Kimutai: zooming on images, data augmentation, more data, add organic class

Keld: trying other models (resnet50, incetion, something other)


### Improve the webapp

road2AGI: design a better app, the user workflow, deploy on heroku

angelinux: documenting application, dockerizing application
