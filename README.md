App project - MMWML

## Concept

# TODO

Find a relevant dataset to start (https://github.com/garythung/trashnet).
Select some classes we want to detect (glass, paper, plastic, metal...).
Build an algorithm so differentiate between these classes.
Using the product information, we can tell which container the product have to be put in.
